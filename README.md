The Pirate Bartender is a simple app and requirement for the Thinkful Python Program Unit 1 Lesson 3. 
The purpose of this program is to make a "pirate" drink based off of simple user inputs. 

The program has three Dictionaries and one list: 

Questions - A list of questions used to determine what kind of ingredients to use for the drink based off of customer preference
Ingredients - The subsequent ingredients to use based off the answers to the questions
Answers - A translation and capture dictionary that renders customers answers to questions to a binary "True" or "False"
drink - Values from the ingredients dictionary based on the population in the Answers dictionary

There are two major functions in the program 

Customer_Ask - This functions seeks input from customers based on questions and subsequent capture of binary answers. 
Customer_Drink - Populates a random list of ingredients (from the ingredients dictionary) based off of the customers answers.
